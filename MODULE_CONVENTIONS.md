# Module Conventions (Screen ↔ Suite)

How to build a workspace screen (navigation, data, UI, permissions) so it matches
the rest of the app. Reference implementation: the **events** area
(`components/internal/screens/events`, `components/internal/screens/overview`)
and the shared kit (`components/internal/shared`).

## Where things go

| Concern | Location | Naming |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace screen | `components/internal/screens/<area>/<name>.jsx` | snake_case file, `*Screen` export |
| Screen ↔ nav wiring | `components/internal/screens/registry.jsx` | title → component map |
| Sidebar nav entries | `components/internal/sidebar/sidebar_nav.jsx` | `title` must match registry key |
| Shared screen primitives | `components/internal/shared/screen_kit.jsx` | `ScreenHeader`, `StatsBar`, `DataTable`… |
| Page-width wrappers | `components/internal/shared/screen_wrappers.jsx` | `MainScreenWrapper`, `SecondaryScreenWrapper` |
| Lookups & formatters | `components/internal/screens/<area>/constants.js` | status/type `*_MAP`, `*_FILTER_OPTIONS`, `formatDate`/`currency` |
| shadcn primitives | `components/ui/*` | `@/components/ui/<name>` |
| Permissions catalog | `lib/rbac.js` | `WORKSPACE_PERMISSIONS`, dot-namespaced keys |
| Supabase client | `lib/supabase/client.js` | `createClient()` (browser, activity-tracked) |
| Data layer (per area) | `lib/supabase/<area>.js` | `list*/get*/create*/update*/softDelete*`, `normalize*/toRow` |
| Media/storage | `lib/supabase/storage.js` | `products` bucket, `events/<id>/` prefix, public URL persisted |
| Signed-in user | `lib/supabase/user.js` | `getUser()` → stamps `created_by` / RLS ownership |
| SQL (when persisted) | `supabase/sqls/*.sql` | `flow_*` tables, idempotent + self-contained DDL |
| Migration runner | `scripts/run-sqls.js` (`npm run db:push`) | `pg` over `STRING_URI`, runs `supabase/sqls/*` in order |
| Environment | `.env` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`_ANON_KEY` (runtime), `STRING_URI` (migrations) |

Files use snake_case names; React components are PascalCase; permission keys are
dot-namespaced (`view.overview`, `team.invite`). All imports use the `@/` root
alias.

## Screens & navigation

- A screen is a `"use client"` component exporting a named `*Screen` (and a
  matching default). It renders inside a width wrapper — `MainScreenWrapper` for
  primary list/overview screens, `SecondaryScreenWrapper` for narrower
  detail/settings screens.
- **Wire it through the registry, never by ad-hoc routing.** Add the component to
  `SCREEN_REGISTRY` in `registry.jsx` keyed by the **exact** sidebar title from
  `sidebar_nav.jsx`. Unlisted titles fall back to `ComingSoonScreen`.
- **Per-entity features are tabs, not top-level screens.** Cover media, tickets,
  visibility, page design, publishing, etc. live as tabs inside the event editor
  (`events/event_detail.jsx`), reached by selecting a row in All Events — they do
  **not** get their own registry entry. Only workspace-level views (Overview,
  All Events, Templates, Event Series…) are registered.
- A list screen swaps to its detail screen by reading the open entity id from the
  URL (`?event=<id>` via `useWorkspaceUrl()`), resolving it against the fetched
  rows, and early-returning the detail component
  (`<EventDetailScreen … onBack={…} />`) — there is no separate route/page push,
  but the id lives in the URL so a refresh/deep-link stays on it.

## Data layer

Screens are **data-layer-first**: the per-area module in `lib/supabase/<area>.js`
is the single source of truth for rows. **Do not seed screen state from a static
in-file array** (`useState(EVENTS)`) and **do not keep mock row data in the
component file** — fetch the real rows from the data layer instead.

- A screen starts **empty** (`useState([])`) with a `loading` flag, fetches via
  `list*()`/`get*()` in a mount effect, and renders a **loading** state, then the
  rows (or an **empty** state when there are none). No static seed array.
- Keep only **constants** in the area's `constants.js` — status/type `*_MAP`
  lookups, `*_FILTER_OPTIONS`, and `formatDate`/`currency` formatters. These are
  config, not data; never put row data there.
- Derive everything else with `useMemo` over the fetched rows — filtered lists,
  KPI stats, grouped views — keyed on `(rows, search, filters)`.
- Mutations are **optimistic**: update local state immediately, persist through
  the data layer, and `toast.error` + reconcile only if the write fails. Mint a
  real UUID up front (`crypto.randomUUID()`) for the optimistic row so it matches
  the inserted DB row.
- Talk to Supabase only through `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client` (a
  browser client whose `fetch` is wrapped for activity tracking — don't construct
  a raw client). The DB is snake_case; the UI is camelCase — map at that boundary
  and keep the screen rendering camelCase view models. Keep data access pure
  (validate, `console.error` on failure, return `null`/`false`/`[]`); the screen
  decides UX (toasts). See **Persistence (Supabase)** below for the full pattern.

## Persistence (Supabase)

The data layer is the source of truth for every screen — see **`SUPABASE_CONVENTIONS.md`**
for the full data-layer playbook (client, `normalize`/`toRow`, RLS, metadata bag);
this is the screen-side summary. Reference: `lib/supabase/events.js`,
`lib/supabase/storage.js`, `supabase/sqls/events.sql`, and the fetch-on-mount load
in `events/all_events.jsx`. (`all_events.jsx` still carries a legacy
`useState(EVENTS)` seed — that is being removed; **don't copy it**.)

### Two clients, two paths

- **Runtime (browser):** `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client` — the
  anon client, `fetch` wrapped for activity tracking. Every data-layer call first
  checks `isSupabaseConfigured()` (both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and
  `_ANON_KEY` present); missing env degrades to "no DB", never crashes.
- **Migrations (Node):** `scripts/run-sqls.js` opens a `pg` client over
  `STRING_URI` (direct Postgres, **server-only**, never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). Run with
  `npm run db:push`; it executes `supabase/sqls/*.sql` in filename order. `--clean`
  drops **only this app's own table** — the Supabase project is **shared across
  the suite**, so never drop all `flow_*` tables.

### Data-layer module shape (`lib/supabase/<area>.js`)

- `"use client"`; a `TABLE` const; `isSupabaseConfigured()` guard on every call.
- `normalize<Entity>(row)` maps snake → camel, **defaults every field**, and
  spreads the `metadata` bag last so promoted keys surface as first-class fields.
- `toRow(input)` maps camel → snake and **emits a column only when its key is
  present in `input`**, so one `update*` serves both a full-form save and a
  single-field inline edit (`{ status }`, `{ visibility }`). Empty-string
  dates/times → `null`; numerics coerced.
- CRUD surface: `list*` / `get*` / `create*` / `update*` / `softDelete*`, plus
  per-area extras (`list*By*`, `update*Meta`). `create*` honors a
  **caller-supplied `id`** so the optimistic row and the DB row share a UUID.
- **Tri-state return contract** the screen branches on — keep it exact:
  - `null` → not configured **or** read failed ⇒ screen renders its empty state
    (and may `toast.error` on a failure)
  - `[]` → configured, no rows ⇒ empty state
  - object / `true` → success;  `false` → a write failed
- Pure: validate, `console.error` on failure, **never throw, never toast**.

### List-screen load pattern

Fetch from the data layer; there is no static seed:

1. Start empty with a loading flag: `useState([])` + `useState(true)` for
   `loading`. Render a loading state until the first fetch resolves.
2. On mount, call `list*()`; `setRows(result ?? [])` and clear `loading`. A
   `null`/`[]` result renders the **empty** state.
3. Mutations update local state **optimistically**, then persist through the data
   layer; `toast.error` and reconcile (re-fetch or roll back) only if the write
   returns falsy. Mint the optimistic row's id with `crypto.randomUUID()` and pass
   it to `create*` so the optimistic row and the inserted row share a UUID.
4. The open entity lives in the **URL** (`?event=<id>` via `useWorkspaceUrl()`),
   not plain state, so refresh/deep-link stays on it.
5. Stamp `createdBy` from `getUser()` (`lib/supabase/user.js`) so storage RLS
   lets only the owner upload that entity's media.

### SQL / DDL (`supabase/sqls/<area>.sql`)

- Tables are **`flow_*`** (suite-shared schema). Standard columns:
  `id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()`,
  `created_at`/`updated_at timestamptz default now()`, and
  `deleted_at timestamptz` for **soft delete** (lists filter `deleted_at is null`).
- Each file is **self-contained + idempotent**: `create extension if not exists
  pgcrypto`, define the shared `flow_touch_updated_at()` trigger function locally
  (don't depend on another migration), `create table if not exists`, then
  `alter table … add column if not exists` to back-fill older copies, and
  `drop … if exists` before re-creating triggers/policies.
- `metadata jsonb default '{}'` is the **expansion bag** — store not-yet-promoted
  per-section config (tickets, page design, SEO…) there; promote to a real column
  once it needs indexing, constraints, or its own RLS. Per-section tab saves go
  through a **shallow-merge RPC** (`flow_event_merge_meta(p_id, p_patch)` →
  `metadata || patch`) so one tab never clobbers another.
- **RLS on**, currently a demo `for all to anon, authenticated using (true)`
  policy; replace with an org-scoped policy (`flow_is_org_member`) when auth lands.
- **Demo seed rows are optional** — if you seed any (`insert … on conflict (id)
  do nothing`), use stable hard-coded UUIDs so shared `/e/<uuid>` links resolve
  to real rows. The screen never depends on the seed; an empty table renders the
  empty state.

### Storage (`lib/supabase/storage.js`)

- Media lives in the public **`products`** bucket under `events/<id>/`. Persist
  the resulting **public URL** in `cover_url`/`gallery`, not the storage path.
- Compress under ~500 KB before upload; writes are **creator-only** (RLS), reads
  public. Helpers return `null`/`false`/`[]` like the data layer.

## Permissions (RBAC)

Authorization here is **advisory UI-gating only** — it hides/disables nav and
controls; it does not secure data.

- The catalog lives in `lib/rbac.js` as `WORKSPACE_PERMISSIONS` — dot-namespaced
  `{ key, label, group }` entries (`view.*` for nav visibility, plus
  `team.*`, `roles.*`, `billing.*`, `settings.*`).
- A nav tab's permission key derives from its title via `tabPermissionKey(title)`
  → `view.<normalized_title>`. Gate a tab by checking
  `roleHasPermission(roles, roleId, key)` (returns `true` when no roles are
  configured, so screens stay reachable by default).
- Role ids are normalized with `normalizeRoleId` and persisted under
  `ROLE_STORAGE_KEY`. To add a gated surface: add the permission to
  `WORKSPACE_PERMISSIONS`, then check it where the nav/control is rendered.

## UI conventions

- **Components:** prefer `shadcn/ui` primitives (`@/components/ui/*`) and
  **Lucide** icons. Build screens out of the shared kit
  (`@/components/internal/shared/screen_kit`) before writing bespoke layout —
  `ScreenHeader`, `StatsBar`/`StatGrid`, `SectionCard`, `Toolbar` + `SearchInput`,
  `DataTable`, `StatusPill`, `EmptyState`, `SettingsList`/`SettingRow`, `Field`.
- **Screen frame:** `MainScreenWrapper` → `ScreenHeader` (title + description over
  a bottom divider, primary action on the right; **no** icon chip or badge) →
  `StatsBar` → `Toolbar` → `DataTable`. Match the Events Overview / All Events
  rhythm.
- **Dialogs:** shadcn `Dialog` with `DialogHeader`/`DialogTitle`/`DialogDescription`,
  a `grid gap-4` of `Field`-wrapped controls, then `DialogFooter` with a ghost
  Cancel + a `bg-primary` primary action. Keep the default close button.
- **Feedback:** Sonner `toast` (`toast.success`/`toast.error`); the Toaster is
  global with `richColors` and **no close button** — don't re-add it.
- **State:** every list has loading, empty, and filtered-empty states (`EmptyState`
  with a "create/clear filters" action). Status is rendered via `StatusPill` +
  a `*_MAP` from the area's `constants.js`.
- **Colors — semantic tokens only, never hardcode hex:**
  - Surfaces: `bg-background`, `bg-surface-subtle|card|hover|active|strong`
  - Text: `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`, `text-text-secondary`,
    `text-text-tertiary`
  - Borders: `border-border`, `border-border-strong`
  - Brand/primary: `bg-primary` + `text-primary-foreground`
  - Destructive: `text-red-400` / `focus:bg-red-500/10` (delete actions)
  - Trend/status: `text-emerald-400` (up) / `text-red-400` (down); badges use
    tailwind color utilities at `/10` bg + `/20` border.

## New-screen checklist

0. **Ask before you build.** A module has too many unstated decisions to guess.
   Before writing code, ask the user about every detail you can't infer from the
   reference: the entity and its **fields/types**, the **status set** and their
   colors, which **filters/sort/search** apply, the **KPIs** for the stats bar,
   what the **detail tabs** are, **create-dialog** required fields and defaults,
   **row actions** (edit/duplicate/delete…), whether it's **gated** (which
   `view.*` permission), and the **persistence shape** (table columns, storage,
   RLS — the screen always reads through the data layer, never a static array).
   Confirm the scope, then build in one pass. Pick an obvious default only when
   the answer is truly inconsequential — and say which default you took.
1. Component at `components/internal/screens/<area>/<name>.jsx` — `"use client"`,
   `*Screen` export, wrapped in `MainScreenWrapper`/`SecondaryScreenWrapper`.
2. Register it in `registry.jsx` under the exact `sidebar_nav.jsx` title (and add
   the nav entry if it's new).
3. Fetch rows from `lib/supabase/<area>.js` (start empty + loading, no static
   seed); keep `*_MAP`/`*_FILTER_OPTIONS`/formatters in `constants.js`; derive
   lists/stats with `useMemo`; mutate optimistically + persist + `toast`.
4. Build the UI from the shared kit + shadcn primitives; three list states;
   semantic color tokens only.
5. (If gated) add a `view.*` permission to `WORKSPACE_PERMISSIONS` and check it
   where the nav/control renders.
